## Data Usage & Privacy

### Why We Request User Data

The BPVA Calendar app requests access to certain user data **exclusively for the following purposes**:

#### Google Account Sign-In
- **Purpose**: Authenticate users securely and provide personalized access to their training information
- **Data Used**: Email address, name, profile photo

#### Google Calendar Access (Admins Only)
- **Purpose**: Allow administrators to select which academy calendars are displayed to users
- **Data Used**: Read-only access to Google Calendar list and events
- **Why**: The app displays training schedules from Google Calendar. Only administrators need calendar access to configure which calendars are shown to athletes and parents

#### Location Data (Athletes Only)
- **Purpose**: Verify athletes are physically present at the gym during check-in
- **Data Used**: Your device location when you tap "Check In"
- **Why**: Location verification prevents fraudulent check-ins and ensures attendance accuracy

#### Push Notifications
- **Purpose**: Send important announcements about schedule changes, cancellations, or academy news
- **Data Used**: Device notification token (no personal data)
- **Why**: Keep you informed of time-sensitive information about training sessions and events
