### Entry Examples

**Basic Practice Entry:**
```
Great practice today! Worked on 4-step approach with 150lb pole. 
Cleared 12'6" easily, hit 13' twice. Coach says my plant is 
improving - need to focus on keeping left arm high. Felt strong, 
good energy. Next time try 160lb pole at 13'.
```

**Detailed Technical Entry:**
```
Practice 1/15/24 - 2:00-4:00pm

Warm-up: 10 min jog, dynamics, runways x3

Main Work:
- 4-step approach, 150lb 13'6" pole, top grip
- Cleared 12'6" (5/5), 13'0" (4/6), 13'6" (2/5)
- Best jump at 13' felt amazing - good rhythm on approach

Technical Focus:
- Plant timing - getting better at hitting step
- Coach: "Drive left knee, keep chest up"
- Right hand grip needs to stay tight through swing

Notes:
- Left ankle slightly sore after warm-up (old injury)
- Energy good despite early wake-up
- Need to work on driving through bar at higher heights

Next Time:
- Try 160lb pole if feeling strong
- Film approach to check step timing
- Ask coach about grip position on bigger pole
```

**Competition Entry:**
```
INDOOR MEET - 1/20/24

13'0" - Clear (first attempt) ✓
13'6" - Clear (second attempt) ✓
14'0" - Miss, Miss, Clear ✓ PR!
14'6" - Miss (3)

New PR! 14'0" felt scary but clean. Used 160lb pole, 
5-step approach. Coach said plant was perfect on PR jump. 
Struggled at 14'6" - not getting under bar. Need more speed 
on approach or bigger pole. Great competition, felt confident.

Equipment: 160lb 14' pole, 5-step (46')
```

## Best Practices

### Consistency
- **Write After Every Practice**: Document while fresh
- **Same Day**: Write before you forget details
- **Competition Notes**: Record meet results immediately
- **Regular Review**: Read old entries to track progress

### Detail Level
- **Be Specific**: "Cleared 13' with 150lb pole" vs. "jumped well"
- **Include Numbers**: Heights, poles, step counts
- **Technique Notes**: What coach said, what you felt
- **Honest Assessment**: Good AND bad - both teach you

### Organization
- **One Entry Per Date**: Keeps journal clean
- **Edit vs. New**: Update today's entry rather than create multiple
- **Delete Sparingly**: Old entries show progress
- **Search Tags**: Use consistent keywords (e.g., always write "competition" not "meet" sometimes)

### Long-Term Value
- **Review Monthly**: Look back at month's progress
- **Season Comparison**: Compare to last year's notes
- **Share with Coaches**: Export PDF for coach review
- **Backup Regularly**: Export PDFs to keep offline copies
