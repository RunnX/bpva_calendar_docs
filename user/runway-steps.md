## Understanding Step Configurations

### Step Number
- **Purpose**: Identifies which step in your approach
- **Common Values**: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
- **Progression**: Track different approach lengths
- **Competition**: Know which step for different heights

### Measurement
- **Distance**: How far back you start
- **Units**: Feet, meters, or custom
- **Precision**: Record exact measurements
- **Consistency**: Use same measurement system
- **Coach Guidance**: Work with coach to find right distances

### Pole Information

#### Weight
- **Purpose**: Track pole stiffness/rating
- **Format**: Typically in pounds (lbs)
- **Example**: "150 lbs", "160 lbs", "12.7"
- **Progression**: Move up as you improve
- **Multiple Poles**: Different weights for different steps

#### Length
- **Purpose**: Record pole length
- **Format**: Feet and inches or metric
- **Example**: "13'6\"", "14'0\"", "4.2m"
- **Standard Lengths**: Common: 13', 13'6", 14', 14'6", 15'
- **Step Dependent**: Longer steps may use longer poles

#### Grip
- **Flexible Field**: Use for any grip-related notes
- **Grip Height**: Where you hold ("12'9\"", "top grip")
- **Hand Position**: Notes about hand placement
- **Adjustments**: Track grip changes
- **Example**: "Top grip", "12'9\" grip", "Hand at 13'"
