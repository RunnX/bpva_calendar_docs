# BPVA Calendar App - Changelog

## Account Linking Implementation (October 2025)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features

#### Manual Account Linking System
- **Implemented** `AccountLinkingService` for Firestore-based account linking
- **Support** for linking Apple and Google accounts with different email addresses
- **Enabled** "Hide My Email" compatibility for Apple Sign-In
- **Created** bidirectional lookup system:
  - `users/{uid}/linkedAccounts/{provider}` - User's linked accounts
  - `account_links/{appleUserId}` - Reverse lookup for Apple user IDs

#### Authentication Flow
- **Primary Account**: First sign-in method (Google or Apple)
- **Secondary Account**: Can be linked later with different email
- **Google Calendar Access**: Maintained regardless of sign-in method
- **App Store Compliance**: Apple Sign-In fully functional

#### Firestore Security Rules
- **User Documents**: Users can read/write their own profile and linked accounts
- **Account Links**: Users can create/update links they own (verified by `primaryFirebaseUid`)
- **Privacy**: Each user can only access their own linking data

### üóëÔ∏è Removed Features

#### Debug/Test Code (No Longer Needed)
- Removed "Test Apple Sign-In" button from admin profile
- Removed "Debug Apple Sign-In" diagnostics button
- Deleted `testAppleSignIn()` method from `AuthService`
- Deleted `checkAppleSignInStatus()` method from `AuthService`

#### Obsolete Documentation
- `apple-key-confusion-explained.md` - JWT debugging docs
- `apple-signin-issue-summary.md` - Firebase linking issue analysis
- `firebase-config-diagnostic.md` - Configuration troubleshooting
- `ipad-testing-guide.md` - Initial testing notes
- `ipad-testing-session-summary.md` - Session notes

### üìù Updated Documentation

#### Kept & Updated
- `apple-signin-setup.md` - Apple Developer Console configuration
- `firebase-apple-signin-setup.md` - Firebase Console setup
- `manual-account-linking.md` - Architecture and implementation details
- `QUICK_START_MANUAL_LINKING.md` - Developer implementation guide
- `README.md` - Updated with authentication features section

### üîß Technical Changes

#### Code Modifications
1. **auth_service.dart**
   - Added `AccountLinkingService` import
   - Replaced Firebase `linkWithCredential()` with manual linking
   - Updated `unlinkAccount()` to use manual unlinking
   - Added Firestore data loading in `loadUserProfile()` and `refreshUserProfile()`
   - Removed test/debug methods

2. **firestore.rules**
   - Added `account_links` collection rules
   - Added `users/{userId}/linkedAccounts` subcollection support (not used, but safe)
   - Fixed field name from `primaryUid` to `primaryFirebaseUid`

3. **admin_my_profile_screen.dart**
   - Removed test/debug UI buttons
   - Removed test dialog methods
   - Kept only production linking functionality

### üéØ Key Benefits

1. **Reliability**: Manual linking via Firestore avoids Firebase SDK bugs
2. **Flexibility**: Emails don't need to match between Google and Apple accounts
3. **Privacy**: Supports Apple's "Hide My Email" feature
4. **Compliance**: Meets App Store requirements for Apple Sign-In
5. **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented implementation

### üì± User Experience

- Users sign in with Google (for Calendar access)
- Users can link their Apple ID from Admin Profile
- After linking, users can sign in with either method
- Unlinking is supported and properly cleans up Firestore data
- Linked accounts persist across app restarts

### üîê Security

- All linking operations verify user ownership
- Firestore rules prevent unauthorized access
- Primary Firebase UID controls data access
- Account links are user-specific and private

**Status**: Production-ready ‚úÖ  
**Tested**: iPad (iOS 18.7), Manual linking works perfectly  
**Deployed**: Firestore rules updated and deployed
