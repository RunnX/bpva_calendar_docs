            <p>The Buckeye Pole Vault Academy Calendar app is intended for use by athletes and their families in connection with training and coaching services. While we welcome athletes of all ages, including minors, the following policies apply:</p>
            
            <h3>9.1 Users Under 18</h3>

            <h3>9.2 Children Under 13</h3>
            <p>We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent. When we collect personal information from children under 13, we do so only with parental consent and in accordance with COPPA requirements.</p>
            
            <h3>9.3 Parental Rights</h3>

        </div>

        <h2>10. Location Information</h2>
        <p>Our app requires access to your device's location for gym check-in functionality. The gym check-in feature cannot function without location permissions, as it verifies you are at the correct gym location. Location data is processed locally and not stored on external servers.</p>

        <h2>11. Push Notifications</h2>
        <p>Our app requires notification permissions to send push notifications about calendar events, training schedules, and important announcements from administrators. While you can control notification preferences in your device settings, disabling notifications will prevent you from receiving important app communications and event reminders.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>
